# After Design Phase - Review Checklist

Review your design to ensure:
- System architecture is clearly defined and logical
- Technology choices are justified and appropriate
- Data models are comprehensive and normalized
- Key technical decisions are documented with rationale
- The design is detailed enough to guide implementation
- `DESIGN.md` file has been created

If anything is unclear or incomplete, update the design. Once satisfied, you have completed the Design phase.

## Git Commit
```bash
git add DESIGN.md design/
git commit -m "design: complete system architecture and data models"
```

Stand by for further instructions.
