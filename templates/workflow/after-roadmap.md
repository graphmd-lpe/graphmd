# After Roadmap Phase - Review Checklist

Review your roadmap to ensure:
- All major phases are clearly defined
- Dependencies are identified and logical
- Priorities make sense for MVP development
- The scope is appropriate and achievable
- `ROADMAP.md` file has been created

If anything is missing, update the roadmap. Once satisfied, you have completed the Roadmap phase.

## Git Commit
```bash
git add ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "roadmap: define project phases and milestones"
```

Stand by for further instructions.
