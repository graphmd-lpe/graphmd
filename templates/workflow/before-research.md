# Research Phase Instructions

## Overview
Conduct thorough research to understand the problem domain, requirements, and constraints.

## Research Activities
1. Analyze the problem statement and requirements
2. Identify key challenges and constraints
3. Research existing solutions and best practices
4. Evaluate technologies and approaches
5. Document findings and insights
6. Identify risks and dependencies

## Artifacts

### Output Artifacts
- `RESEARCH.md` file containing:
  - Problem analysis
  - Technology options
  - Constraints and limitations
  - Recommendations
  - Risk assessment
- `research/` directory (optional, for additional research files)

## Guidance
- **Produce small, focused outputs** rather than large documents
- Take time to explore and understand the problem space
- **Focus on understanding, not speed**
