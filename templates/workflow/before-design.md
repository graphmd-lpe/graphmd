# Design Phase Instructions

## Overview
Create a comprehensive design for the system architecture, data models, and key technical decisions.

## Design Requirements

1. **System Architecture**
   - High-level system components and their interactions
   - Technology stack decisions with justification
   - Integration points and APIs

2. **Data Models**
   - Database schema or data structures
   - Key entities and relationships
   - Data flow diagrams

3. **Technical Decisions**
   - Frameworks and libraries to use
   - Design patterns and architectural patterns
   - Security considerations
   - Performance considerations

4. **Interface Design**
   - API contracts and endpoints (if applicable)
   - User interface wireframes or mockups (if applicable)
   - Component structure

## Artifacts

### Input Artifacts (if available)
- `RESEARCH.md` file (research findings)
- `research/` directory (additional research files)

### Output Artifacts
- `DESIGN.md` file containing:
  - **Architecture Overview** - System components and how they interact
  - **Technology Stack** - Detailed technology choices with rationale
  - **Data Models** - Schemas, entities, relationships
  - **Key Decisions** - Important technical decisions and trade-offs
  - **Diagrams** - Visual representations (ASCII art, mermaid, or descriptions)
- `design/` directory (optional, for additional design files)

## Guidance
Focus on clear, detailed design that can guide implementation. Include rationale for key decisions.
