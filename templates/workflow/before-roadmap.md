## Roadmap Requirements
1. Break down the project into major phases or features
2. Define clear milestones and deliverables
3. Identify dependencies between phases
4. Estimate complexity (not time) for each phase
5. Prioritize work based on value and dependencies

## Artifacts

### Input Artifacts (if available)
- `RESEARCH.md` file (research findings)
- `DESIGN.md` file (design documentation)

### Output Artifacts
- `ROADMAP.md` file containing:
  - **Executive Summary** - High-level overview of the project
  - **Phases** - Major phases with goals and deliverables
  - **Milestones** - Key checkpoints and success criteria
  - **Dependencies** - What depends on what
  - **Priorities** - What should be done first and why
