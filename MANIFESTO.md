## 📜 Manifesto

1. As of today, the term `AI` is overhyped, and 99% of content about `AI` is nothing more than marketing bullshit (the bubble).
2. The backbone of what is called `AI` is just optimized statistical models.
3. An `LLM` is a statistical model for generating templates, trained on large text datasets.
4. You should review hard the output of any `LLM` before using it.
5. **GraphMD is anti-AGI.** We don't believe in or pursue Artificial General Intelligence. Instead, we focus on practical, verifiable, human-supervised AI assistance.

This project attempts to formalize the process of using `LLM`s as template generators in a reliable, reproducible, and reviewable way.

### 🎯 Anti-AGI Positioning

**GraphMD explicitly rejects the AGI narrative.**

- ❌ **Not pursuing AGI** - We don't believe current approaches lead to general intelligence
- ❌ **Not autonomous agents** - Humans must always be in control
- ❌ **Not "thinking machines"** - LLMs are statistical pattern generators, not minds
- ✅ **Human-supervised assistance** - AI as a tool, not a replacement
- ✅ **Verifiable workflows** - Every step reviewed and validated
- ✅ **Reproducible processes** - Documented, testable, auditable
- ✅ **Mathematical rigor** - Formal verification over blind trust

**Why anti-AGI matters:**
1. **Safety** - Structured workflows prevent runaway automation
2. **Accountability** - Humans responsible for all decisions
3. **Quality** - Review and validation ensure correctness
4. **Honesty** - We don't promise what we can't deliver
5. **Focus** - Build practical tools, not science fiction

**Our approach:** Treat LLMs as sophisticated autocomplete, not artificial minds. Use them within formal structures that guarantee human oversight, validation, and control.

### ⚔️ Fighting AGI Development

**GraphMD doesn't just reject AGI—we actively fight against attempts to create it.**

The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence is:
- **Technically misguided** - Current approaches won't achieve general intelligence
- **Dangerously irresponsible** - Racing toward uncontrollable systems
- **Socially harmful** - Diverting resources from solving real problems
- **Intellectually dishonest** - Marketing fantasies sold as scientific progress

**How GraphMD fights back:**

1. **Proving the alternative works** - Demonstrating that structured, verifiable AI assistance is more practical and safer than AGI fantasies
2. **Building constraints** - Creating formal verification systems (Pruf) that prevent uncontrolled AI behavior
3. **Enforcing human control** - Designing workflows where humans must validate every step
4. **Exposing the hype** - Showing that LLMs are statistical models, not minds
5. **Focusing on reality** - Solving actual development problems instead of chasing sci-fi dreams

**GraphMD proves you don't need AGI for effective AI assistance.** You need structure, verification, and human oversight.

**Join the fight:** Use GraphMD. Build tools that keep humans in control. Reject autonomous agents. Demand verification. Choose practical solutions over AGI hype.
