# 📜 Manifesto

1. As of today, the term `AI` is overhyped, and 99% of content about `AI` is nothing more than marketing bullshit (the bubble).
2. The backbone of what is called `AI` is just optimized statistical models.
3. An `LLM` is a statistical model for generating templates, trained on large text datasets.
4. You should review hard the output of any `LLM` before using it.

This project attempts to formalize the process of using `LLM`s as template generators in a reliable, reproducible, and reviewable way.
