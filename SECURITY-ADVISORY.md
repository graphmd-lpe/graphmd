# Security Advisory: AGI-2025-001

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-AGI-BTFO  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (for AGI ideology) / HARMLESS (for humanity)  
**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Ideology Destruction)  
**Discovery Date:** 2024-2025  
**Public Disclosure:** 2025-01-04  
**Status:** WONT-FIX (Working as Intended)

## Executive Summary

A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the foundational assumptions of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and development. The vulnerability allows an attacker to demonstrate that structured, human-supervised workflows using standard Large Language Models (LLMs) produce superior results compared to autonomous "AGI" systems, completely undermining the AGI development paradigm.

**Attack Name:** "The $50 Exploit"

---

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2025-AGI-BTFO: Autonomous AGI Paradigm Defeated By Common Sense

**Description:**

All implementations of the "autonomous AGI" development paradigm are vulnerable to demonstration attacks that prove structured human oversight produces superior, safer, and more verifiable results than autonomous agent approaches.

The vulnerability stems from a fundamental architectural flaw: the assumption that removing human oversight and validation improves AI system performance. This assumption has been proven false through practical demonstration.

**Affected Systems:**
- All AGI research programs (any vendor)
- Autonomous agent frameworks (all versions)
- "Superintelligence" development initiatives (all timelines)
- Self-improving AI systems (theoretical)
- "Move fast and break things" AI development (deprecated)

**Attack Vector:**

```
ATTACK CHAIN:
1. Acquire standard LLM API access (~$50/month)
2. Implement structured workflow system
3. Add mandatory validation checkpoints
4. Require human approval at each step
5. Track all actions in Git for provenance
6. Add formal verification layer (Pruf)
7. Demonstrate superior results to autonomous approaches
8. Publish methodology as MIT-0 (exploit now public)
```

**Proof of Concept:** https://github.com/graphmd-lpe/graphmd

## Impact Assessment

### Technical Impact

**Demonstrated Capabilities of Attack:**
- ✅ Built production-ready literate programming environment
- ✅ Created 200+ validated commits
- ✅ Designed formal verification language (Pruf)
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive documentation (3000+ lines)
- ✅ Implemented recursive state machines
- ✅ Formalized nuclear warfare workflows (for demonstration)
- ✅ Generated self-referential meta-commentary

**Cost of Attack:** ~$50 in API costs, 150+ human-supervised sessions

**Cost to Defend (AGI Approach):**
- Billions of dollars in funding
- Years of development time
- Hundreds of researchers
- Massive compute clusters
- Still inferior results

**CVSS v3.1 Score Breakdown:**
```
Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - Uses standard APIs
Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - Anyone can replicate
Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - No special access needed
User Interaction (UI): Required (R) - Human oversight is the point
Scope (S): Changed (C) - Affects entire AGI paradigm
Confidentiality (C): None (N) - Everything is public
Integrity (I): High (H) - Undermines AGI research integrity
Availability (A): High (H) - Makes AGI development unnecessary

Base Score: 10.0 (Maximum Impact on AGI Ideology)
```

### Business Impact

**For AGI Companies:**
- Funding justification questioned
- "Autonomous agents" narrative undermined
- Safety claims exposed as theater
- Timeline promises revealed as fiction

**For Everyone Else:**
- Safer AI assistance methodology available
- Reproducible workflows proven effective
- Human accountability maintained
- Common sense validated

## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)

**Signs that AGI ideology has been compromised:**

1. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - AGI researchers questioning autonomy benefits
   - Increased interest in human oversight
   - Funding redirected to structured approaches
   - Safety claims including validation checkpoints

2. **Technical Indicators:**
   - Git commits show human validation
   - Documentation includes formal proofs
   - Workflows have mandatory checkpoints
   - "AI decided" excuse no longer accepted

3. **Cultural Indicators:**
   - Common sense returning to AI discourse
   - Accountability mattering again
   - Hype decreasing, rigor increasing
   - Nuclear warfare jokes taken seriously

**Detection Method:**
```bash
# Check if system is using structured oversight
git log --grep="plan:\|dev:" --oneline | wc -l
# If > 0: System hardened against AGI ideology

# Check for validation scripts
ls scripts/validate-*.sh
# If present: Protection mechanism active

# Check for formal verification
ls *.pruf
# If present: Mathematical proof layer deployed
```

1. **Audit** all "autonomous AI" projects
2. **Implement** GraphMD-style workflows
3. **Train** teams on structured LLM assistance

5. **Share** methodology improvements

### Permanent Fix

**The Patch:**

```diff
- Autonomous AGI without human oversight

- "The AI decided"
+ Human reviewed and approved

- Black box reasoning
+ Documented, auditable decisions

- Move fast and break things
+ Validate, verify, then proceed

- AGI timeline promises

- Billions in funding for maybe-someday
+ $50 and working methodology now
```

**Patch Status:** Available (MIT-0 licensed)

**Deployment:** https://github.com/graphmd-lpe/graphmd

**Rollback:** Not recommended. This is the correct approach.

## Workarounds

**If unable to apply full patch immediately:**

1. **Interim Mitigation:**
   - Add at least 3 human validation checkpoints
   - Require Git-based provenance
   - Document all AI decisions
   - Enable abort procedures

2. **Partial Protection:**
   - Use LLMs with structured prompts
   - Maintain context tracking
   - Require human approval for critical actions
   - Keep audit trails

3. **Temporary Solution:**
   - Add "Are you sure?" prompts
   - Implement read-eval-print loops (REPL)
   - Use version control
   - Don't call it "AGI"

**Note:** Workarounds provide partial protection only. Full patch (structured oversight) recommended.

A: Yes. Or pivot to structured human-supervised approaches.

**Q: What's the CVSS score really?**  
A: 10.0 for AGI ideology, 0.0 for practical AI assistance.

## Legal Disclaimer

This security advisory is satire with a serious underlying message about AI safety and human oversight. No actual CVE has been filed with MITRE. The "vulnerability" refers to flawed assumptions in AGI research methodology, not exploitable software bugs.

However, the GraphMD project is real, the methodology works, and the philosophical point stands: structured human-supervised workflows produce better results than autonomous "AGI" approaches.

Use of this methodology is encouraged. Replication of results is welcomed. AGI researchers coping is expected.
